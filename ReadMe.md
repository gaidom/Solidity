# Solidity Smart Contract
This Solidity contract implements an ERC-20 token with minting and burning capabilities, allowing the creation and destruction of tokens within the token system. Minting generates new tokens to increase the total supply, while burning removes existing tokens from circulation.

## Description

A Solidity smart contract that creates and manages a custom token. The contract includes various functionalities, such as minting new tokens and burning existing ones, all while ensuring proper balance checks.

## Getting Started

### To successfully work with the Solidity smart contract, you will need two essential tools:

* Solidity Compiler (solc): This compiler is used to convert the contract code written in Solidity into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The Solidity compiler ensures that your code is syntactically correct and ready for deployment. You can find the Solidity compiler online or install it locally on your computer.
* Development Environment or IDE: It's important to have a user-friendly development environment or integrated development environment (IDE) to write, test, and deploy your contract. Two popular options are Remix and Truffle. These tools provide a user-friendly interface with features like code highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging capabilities. They also offer built-in testing frameworks to ensure the reliability and functionality of your contract.

### Executing program

* Install Remix: Remix is a web-based IDE for Solidity development. It allows you to write, compile, and deploy Solidity contracts directly from your browser. 
* Alternatively, use Truffle: Truffle is a popular development framework that provides a suite of tools for building and testing Ethereum applications. It simplifies the development process and offers advanced features.
* Compile and deploy: Once you have the IDE set up, you can compile your Solidity code and deploy it to the Ethereum network. This requires an Ethereum client to connect to the network and deploy the compiled bytecode.
